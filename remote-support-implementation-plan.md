# Remote Support Implementation Plan for TechFlow Solutions

## Key Research Findings Summary

**CRITICAL ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION**: 
❌ **Windows Quick Assist and Chrome Remote Desktop do NOT allow UAC elevation**
- Both solutions run in user context only
- Technician cannot bypass or control UAC prompts
- Customer must manually approve all administrative actions
- This severely limits your ability to install software, drivers, or make system changes

## Recommended Solution: RustDesk + Windows Quick Assist Hybrid

Based on your requirements for full administrative access and budget constraints, I recommend implementing **RustDesk** as the primary solution with **Windows Quick Assist** as backup.

### Why RustDesk?
- ✅ **Free and Open Source** - No commercial restrictions
- ✅ **UAC Elevation Support** - Full administrative access
- ✅ **Professional Features** - File transfer, unattended access
- ✅ **Self-hosting Option** - Better control and privacy
