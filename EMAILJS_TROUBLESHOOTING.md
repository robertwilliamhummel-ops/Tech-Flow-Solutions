# EmailJS Troubleshooting - Email Not Arriving in Zoho

You're getting HTTP 200 (success) from EmailJS but emails aren't arriving in your Zoho mailbox. Here are the most common causes and solutions:

## 1. Check EmailJS Template Configuration

**Problem**: Template might not have the correct "To Email" field configured.

**Solution**: 
1. Go to your EmailJS dashboard
2. Open your template (`template_dwmz48t`)
3. Make sure the **"To Email"** field is set to: `rob@techflowsolutions.ca`
4. Save the template

## 2. Check Zoho Mail Folders

**Check These Locations**:
- **Inbox** - Primary location
- **Spam/Junk Folder** - Most common issue
- **Quarantine** - Zoho's security filter
- **Trash** - Sometimes auto-deleted

**Solution**: Log into Zoho Mail and check all folders, especially Spam.

## 3. Verify Zoho Mail Setup

**Check if Zoho Mail is fully configured**:
1. Can you send emails FROM rob@techflowsolutions.ca?
2. Can you receive emails TO rob@techflowsolutions.ca from other sources?
3. Are MX records properly configured?

**Test**: Send a test email from Gmail to rob@techflowsolutions.ca

## 4. EmailJS Service Configuration Issue

**Problem**: EmailJS service might not be properly connected to Zoho.

**Solution**:
1. Go to EmailJS Dashboard → Email Services
2. Find your service (`service_fpx3i2b`)
3. Click "Test Connection"
4. If it fails, reconfigure with correct Zoho SMTP settings:
   - SMTP Server: `smtp.zoho.com`
   - Port: `587`
   - Username: `rob@techflowsolutions.ca`
   - Password: Your Zoho Mail password
   - Security: TLS

## 5. Template Variable Issues

**Problem**: Template variables might not be mapping correctly.

**Current Template Should Include**:
```
To: {{to_email}}
From: {{firstName}} {{lastName}}
Email: {{email}}
Phone: {{phone}}
Service Type: {{serviceType}}
Location: {{location}}
Urgency: {{urgency}}
Date: {{date}}
Time: {{time}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
Submitted: {{submission_date}}
Form Type: {{form_type}}
```

## 6. Zoho Mail Security Settings

**Problem**: Zoho might be blocking emails from EmailJS.

**Solution**:
1. Log into Zoho Mail
2. Go to Settings → Security
3. Check if there are any blocked senders
4. Add EmailJS domains to whitelist if needed

## 7. Domain Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Your domain might not be properly verified with Zoho.

**Check**:
1. Domain verification status in Zoho
2. SPF records
3. DKIM records
4. MX records

## Quick Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Test EmailJS Template Directly
1. Go to EmailJS Dashboard
2. Open your template
3. Click "Test" button
4. Send a test email
5. Check if it arrives in Zoho

### Step 2: Check EmailJS Logs
1. Go to EmailJS Dashboard
2. Check "Usage" or "Logs" section
3. Look for any error messages

### Step 3: Verify Zoho Mail Works
1. Send email from another service (Gmail) to rob@techflowsolutions.ca
2. If this doesn't work, the issue is with Zoho setup

## Most Likely Solutions

**1. Check Spam Folder** (90% of cases)
**2. Verify EmailJS template "To Email" field**
**3. Test Zoho Mail with external email**
