## Image Guidelines:
- All images should be optimized for web (compressed but high quality)
- Use WebP format where possible for better compression
- Include alt text for accessibility
- Maintain consistent professional styling
- Use high-resolution images that scale well on different devices

## Placeholder Images:
For development purposes, you can use placeholder images from:
- https://picsum.photos/ for generic images
- https://via.placeholder.com/ for specific dimensions
- Professional stock photo services for final production images

## Image Optimization:
- Compress images using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
- Use appropriate dimensions for each use case
- Consider lazy loading for better performance
- Implement responsive images with srcset when needed
